# The Innovation Game - Offworld Challenge

## Objective
**Offworld Trading Company** is a computer game of economic warfare taking place on Mars. 

The challenge is to develop an AI to buyout the opponent AI's corporation within 7 Martian days.

## Repo Structure

* `Offworld.Algorithms` contains all the uploaded algorithms for this challenge. Any algorithm you develop should go in here
* `Offworld.Challenge` contains the logic for running & verifying algorithms for this challenge
* `Offworld.MyGameCore` contains boilerplate code to bridge the challenge logic with Offworld Trading Company's game logic
* `Offworld.Runner` contains an executable program for debugging / running your algorithms during development
* `Offworld.Tests` contains tests for the challenge logic 
* `Assembly-CSharp` is a stub of Offworld Trading Company's non-game logic library.
* `Assembly-CSharp-firstpass` is a modified version of Offworld Trading Company's game logic library.
* `UnityEngine` is a stub of UnityEngine for Offworld Trading Company.

## Getting Started

1. [Install Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)

2. Fork and clone this repo

3. Create a branch for your algorithm
```
git checkout -b <your handle>/algorithm/<algorithm name>
```

3. Open `Offworld.sln` with Visual Studio 2022

4. Set `Offworld.Runner` as your startup project

5. Make a copy of `Offworld.Algorithms\Template.cs` and rename filename & class to your algorithm name

* Modify `Offworld.Runner\Program.cs` to use your algorithm and start developing / debugging!

## Rules

You should adhere to the following rules if you want to "upload" an algorithm:

1. See `Uploading Algorithms` in the [main docs](https://test.the-innovation-game.com/get-involved) for the non-challenge specific rules

2. Your algorithm must implement the base class in `Offworld.Algorithms\Abstract.cs`:
    * `override` the `AI_doActions` function
    * if you need randomness, use the provided `System.Random` instance: `this.Random`

3. You are allowed to read any state from the game

4. You are only allowed to make actions for your player
    * See [`Assembly-CSharp-firstpass\GameCore\Game.cs::handleAction`](https://github.com/the-innovation-game/offworld-challenge/blob/main/Assembly-CSharp-firstpass/GameCore/Game.cs#L5184) for all the actions you can make)

5. You are not allowed to change the game options

6. You are allowed to add new stubs for `Assembly-CSharp` and/or `UnityEngine` as necessary for debugging in-game

7. If you want to give up on the challenge (e.g. maybe its unwinnable), you should call `concede()`

8. Your algorithm class name and filename must be `<algorithm_name>.cs`

9. All your utility classes should be contained in a separate namespace `Offworld.Algorithms.<algorithm_name>Utils`

10. If you are improving an existing algorithm, make a copy of the file before making modifications


## Debugging your Offworld AI

It is highly recommended to have a [Steam copy of the game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/271240/Offworld_Trading_Company/) for debugging purposes
   * Note: an Epic games copy will not support mods and versions

See [Offworld-Mods Repo](https://github.com/the-innovation-game/offworld-mods) for instructions on how to debug your AI in-game.
